# CONTRAST: Contrastive Temperature-Regulated Adaptive Session Training

This is the official implementation for the *"Adaptive Session-based Recommendation with Contrastive Learning"* paper. It includes data processing of datasets (RetailRocket and Diginetica) that we used to train and test our model. 

### ðŸ”— Notebooks on Kaggle
- **[CONTRAST Data Pipeline](https://www.kaggle.com/code/farneetsingh24/contrast-data-pipeline)**: Clean, transform, and structure raw data into usable session datasets.
- **[CONTRAST Model Implementation](https://www.kaggle.com/code/farneetsingh24/contrast-model-implementation)**: Implementation of the CONTRAST architecture with training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Datasets

The framework was evaluated on two benchmark datasets:

| Dataset       | Train Sessions | Test Sessions | Unique Items | Avg. Session Length |
|---------------|----------------|---------------|---------------|----------------------|
| RetailRocket  | 433,643        | 15,132        | 41,762        | 5.64                 |
| Diginetica    | 719,470        | 60,858        | 37,867        | 4.06                 |

The preprocessing steps are encapsulated in the **Data Pipeline Notebook**.

## Running the Notebooks

To experiment with the CONTRAST model or its data pipeline:

1. Open the corresponding Kaggle notebook links.
2. Fork the notebook to your Kaggle account.
3. Run all cells (ensure GPU is enabled for faster training).
